# python-bioinf
Some simple bioinformatics scripts I created over time.

The scripts are for all sort of things that were useful for me at some time and represent various stages of scripting experience.

Feel free to use if you find it helpful, and ask questions. But I cannot guarantee any support whatsoever. There may not ever be any updates. Use at your own risk.
